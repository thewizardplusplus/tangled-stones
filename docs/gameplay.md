## Description of the Game Field

The game field is represented by a set of square stones. The stones are arranged in the field center close to each other in the form of a square grid.

Every two stones except for one (number of stones is odd) are connected to each other by a rope. The pairing of the stones is random.

The game field is bounded by a barrier. There is a hole in the center of the bottom side of the barrier.
