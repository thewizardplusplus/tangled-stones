## Description of the Game Field

The game field is represented by a set of square stones. The stones are arranged in the field center close to each other in the form of a square grid.

Every two stones except for one (number of stones is odd) are connected to each other by a rope. The pairing of the stones is random.

The game field is bounded by a barrier. There is a hole in the center of the bottom side of the barrier.

## Functioning of the Game Field

The player can move any stone. Other stones and the barrier are obstacles.

By default, all stones are frozen, i.e. they cannot move. When the player interacts with a stone, it is unfrozen. The stone connected to it is also unfrozen. All other stones remain frozen and still cannot move! After the end of interaction with stones, the latter are frozen again.

The rope connecting the stones is indestructible. Its length may decrease, but it cannot increase. The connected stones may not be further apart than they were created, but they may be closer.

If a stone is moved outside the barrier, it is removed from the game field.

## Game Goal and Statistics

The game goal is to clear the game field of stones. This is done by moving the stones into the hole in the barrier.

The game keeps statistics by memorizing the minimum number of actions for all game sessions. One action in this case is a continuous movement of a stone (i.e., let go of the stone â€” complete the action).
